## Project Structure

How to structure large React apps into folders and files is a highly opinionated topic. There is no right way to do it. However, let set up conventions to structure this React app:

- Put your stateless components in `/src/components/`, because we plan to **"reuse"** these components. Tip: if your component needs to access to the global store, put it in `/src/containers/`
- Keep all the components that manage the states, and logics in `/src/containers/`
- `src/redux/actions`: each file in this folder is related to a set of actions, e.g. `auth.actions.js`. **Rule**: only put API Connection in actions files.
- `src/redux/reducers`: set of reducers for managing the global store. They are combined in `index.js`.
- `src/redux/constants`: set of types of actions
- `src/redux/store.js`: configuration of the store

In the end, you will have a project structure like this:

  ```
  |- src\
    |- components\
      |- AlertMsg.js
      |- PaginationBar.js
      |- MemeList.js
      |- NavbarHeader.js
      |- NotFoundPage.js
    |- containers\
      |- GalleryPage.js
      |- HomePage.js
      |- SideMenu.js
      |- Routes\
    |- images\
    |- redux\
        |- actions\
        |- constants\
        |- reducers\
        |- api.js
        |- store.js
    |- App.css
    |- App.js
    |- index.js
  |- .env
  |- .gitignore
  |- package.json
  |- jsconfig.json
  |- README.md
  ```

- You can use command line to create folders quickly, e.g.

  ```bash
  $ mkdir src/components src/containers src/containers/Routes src/redux src/redux/actions src/redux/constants src/redux/reducers
  $ touch src/redux/api.js src/redux/store.js
  ```

Good job! [Back to instructions](/client.md)
